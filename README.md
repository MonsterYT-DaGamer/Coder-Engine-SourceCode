# Coder Engine: Source Code
This is the source code of a Code.org FNF Engine called "Coder Engine." You can use this source code to edit the code using your favorite code editors like VSC (Visual Studio Code), MonoGDB Atlas, etc.!
Btw the code isnt finished yet, if you download the .zip all you will get are the frames of all the images I've used so far.

# Description
Coder Engine is a Code.org project made by MonsterYT Da Gamer, and other people as said in the **Credits** Section. Coder Engine (also known as **CD**) is a FNF inspired project in Code.org! It's also inspired by FNF's **Psych Engine**, because I just like note splashes and events and stuff. And yeah thats pretty much it for the **Description** section..
